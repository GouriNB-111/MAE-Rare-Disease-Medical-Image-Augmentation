This project implements a Transformer-based Masked Autoencoder (MAE) 
for synthetic image generation and class balancing on the DermaMNIST dataset.

Status: Manuscript currently under review.
Presented at an International Conference, Bangkok, Thailand.

Code includes:
- MAE pretraining
- Synthetic minority class augmentation
- DeiT-Tiny classifier training
- Evaluation using Accuracy, Macro-F1, Weighted-F1
